# StarGoals
StarGoals is a Geode Mod for the fellow star grinders on Geometry Dash that allows you to set a goal.  
  
The more you beat star rated levels, the more you reach your goal.  
  
To use this, pause during a level and you should see a star button.  
Click it and see your star count and your daily star goal!  
(Impossible to set the goal other then 250 at the moment, wait until an update)
